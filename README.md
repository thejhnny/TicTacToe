1. Start a new game by setting a var to new Game();
  ex) var game1 = new Game();

2. Make move by calling makeMove(position). Position is the number between 1-9 corresponding to position you want to pick.
  ex) game1.makeMove(1)

3. Alternates turn and if someone wins or there's a tie, it'll tell you.

4. To start a new game simply restart from step 1.
